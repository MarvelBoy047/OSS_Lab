## ü§ñ AI Integration

### LLM Integration

OSS_Lab leverages high-performance open-source models like **Llama-3-70B** through the Groq API for:

- **Conversational AI**: Natural language interactions with context awareness.
- **Code Generation**: Automatic creation of analysis scripts and notebooks.
- **Data Analysis**: Intelligent interpretation of datasets and trends.
- **Research Assistance**: Comprehensive answers with integrated web search.

### Example Workflow

1. **Upload Data**: Drop a CSV file into the chat interface.
2. **Ask Questions**: "Analyze this sales data and show trends".
3. **Get Insights**: The AI generates analysis and creates a Jupyter notebook.
4. **Explore Results**: Open the interactive notebook with code, visualizations, and explanations.

## üìñ Usage Guide

### Basic Chat

1. The application will open at `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Start typing in the chat interface to get answers from the AI.
3. Upload files for analysis by clicking the paperclip icon.

### Data Analysis

1. Upload a CSV, JSON, or Excel file.
2. Ask questions about your data (e.g., "Find the correlation between column A and B").
3. The AI will automatically generate analysis code and a notebook.
4. View results in the integrated notebook viewer and export for sharing.

### Settings Configuration

> [!NOTE]
> Your Groq API key is required to power the AI features. You can get a free key from [Groq](https://console.groq.com/keys).

1. Navigate to **Settings** in the sidebar.
2. Enter your Groq API key.
3. Configure AI features and choose between light and dark themes.
